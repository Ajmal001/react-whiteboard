# react-whiteboard

### Setup

Make sure you have installed Node.js. https://nodejs.org/en/

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/adarsh1021/react-whiteboard`
2. `cd react-whiteboard`
2. Install all dependencies `npm install`
3. To run the application `node server` 
4. Open the index.html file, in different browsers to see it in action. 

#### How it works
The frontend of the whiteboard app is written fully in javascript. So now the frontend of the whiteboard can be integrated into any frontend libraries. 
The backend depends on socket.io, which is run using the `node server` command.
